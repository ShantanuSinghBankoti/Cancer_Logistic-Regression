Part 1: Data Preprocessing

Importing the dataset

Splitting the dataset into a training set and test set

Part 2: Training and Inference

Training the logistic regression model on the training set

Predicting the test set results

Part 3: Evaluating the Model

Making the confusion matrix

Computing the accuracy with k-Fold cross-validation
