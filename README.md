# Cancer_Logistic-Regression

Detect breast cancer by applying a logistic regression model on a real-world dataset and predict whether a tumor is benign (not breast cancer) or malignant (breast cancer)
based off its characteristics.

Variables:

Clump thickness

Uniformity of cell size

Uniformity of cell shape

Marginal adhesion

Single epithelial cell

Bare Nuclei

Bland chromatin

Normal nucleoli

Mitoses

Steps:

1: Data Preprocessing

Importing the dataset

Splitting the dataset into a training set and test set

2: Training and Inference

Training the logistic regression model on the training set

Predicting the test set results

3: Evaluating the Model

Making the confusion matrix

Computing the accuracy with k-Fold cross-validation
