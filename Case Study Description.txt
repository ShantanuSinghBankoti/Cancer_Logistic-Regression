Detect breast cancer by applying a logistic regression model on a real-world dataset and predict whether a tumor is benign (not breast cancer) or malignant (breast cancer)
based off its characteristics.
By the end of the course, you will be able to build a logistic regression model to identify correlations between the following 9 independent variables and
the class of the tumor (benign or malignant).

Variables:

Clump thickness

Uniformity of cell size

Uniformity of cell shape

Marginal adhesion

Single epithelial cell

Bare Nuclei

Bland chromatin

Normal nucleoli
